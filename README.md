# Heart Disease Risk Prediction with Explainable AI

This project applies machine learning models to predict heart disease risk using clinical data and explains model decisions using SHAP.

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Explainable AI
SHAP was used to analyze the importance of global and local features and understand how clinical features influence predictions.

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter notebook and run cells sequentially to reproduce results.

## Key Results
- Model performance evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Interpretable insights into important clinical risk factors
